ZNC Helper will work with PURPLE_MAJOR_VERSION 2, but you must compile
it with the minor version of purple that you plan to use it with.

You must have glib, purple and pidgin development headers and libraries in order
to build this package.  On Debian Etch just do the following and you'll
get everything you need:

apt-get install pidgin-dev

Everything should build with the customary:

./configure
make
make install

Remember that "./configure --help" will show all the options available
to help cope with odd setups, installations, and paths.

Please note that you have copy a theme that supports this plugin to the themes directory in the .purple user directory of each user. You can find the default theme on https://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin-p-status/ .

After activating the plugin you have to choose the plugins default status icon theme (or any other status icon theme that supports this plugin) in "Tools -> Preferences".
